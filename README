This is a very simple [milter](https://www.milter.org/) implementation
in pure Python, including a sample milter.  I'm using this to filter
spam under Postfix on panacea.canonical.org, which is Bad and Wrong
for several reasons:

1. I could do the same thing more easily with sender and recipient
   restrictions.
2. Postfix's "policy service" interface is about a thousand times
   saner than the Milter interface, and performs the same job.
   Writing to the Milter interface means 

About Milters
-------------

Milters are a way to reject or modify mail before it goes into the
mail queue.  I care about this because it lets me bounce spam to its
real sender, not the forged from-address on the mail, so I don't
become part of the backscatter problem.

MTAs that support milters include
[Sendmail](http://www.sendmail.org/),
[Postfix](http://www.postfix.org), and
[qpsmtpd](http://smtpd.develooper.com/).

Sendmail includes `libmilter`, which lets you write milters in C.

I'm using the sample milter to bounce unauthorized mail to some
Mailman mailing lists, on a machine with Postfix, so that our server
doesn't generate backscatter.  I'm probably going to switch away from
it shortly because it turns out Postfix has a built-in feature that
does more or less the same thing.
